Additionally, content-based filtering considers features like genre, director, and actors to enhance accuracy. By amalgamating both approaches, the system achieves a holistic understanding of user preferences.

To ensure real-time relevance, our system employs matrix factorization, deep learning, and hybrid models. The collaborative approach taps into user behavior, while the content-based approach enriches suggestions with intricate film characteristics. Moreover, incorporating sentiment analysis from user reviews refines predictions.
